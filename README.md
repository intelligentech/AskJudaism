### Recommenations
I found 's Gemini Pro models work best (specifically Pro 2.5 and 3 Preview), but other models also excel! Ideally, for true deep study, you want to use a chat UI that can prompt multiple models simultaneously. I've long used typingmind.com for that. 

Recommended models (in order): Gemini Pro 3 Preview, Gemini Pro 2.5, Grok 4.1, GPT 5 Chat, Claude Sonnet 4 (1M), GPT 4.1
