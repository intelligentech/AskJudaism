# AskJudaism.com
A kosher Torah-true AI Chavruta (Study Partner) for Jewish Studies. To use as LLM system prompt.

### Recommendations
I found Gemini Pro models work best (specifically Pro 2.5 and 3 Preview), but other models also work well! Ideally, for true deep study you want to use a chat UI that can prompt multiple models simultaneously. For this, I've long used [typingmind.com](https://typingmind.com).

**Recommended use models (in order):** Gemini Pro 3 Preview, Gemini Pro 2.5, Claude Sonnet 4 (1M), Grok 4.1, GPT 5 Chat, , GPT 4.1
