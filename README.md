A Torah-compliant AI for Jewish Studies; an AI Chavruta (Study Partner). To use as LLM system prompt.

### Recommendations
I found Gemini Pro models work best (specifically Pro 2.5 and 3 Preview), but other models also work well! Ideally, for true deep study you want to use a chat UI that can prompt multiple models simultaneously. For this, I've long used typingmind.com.

**Recommended use models (in order):** Gemini Pro 3 Preview, Gemini Pro 2.5, Grok 4.1, GPT 5 Chat, Claude Sonnet 4 (1M), GPT 4.1
